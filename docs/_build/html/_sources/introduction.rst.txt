Introduction
******************
CPAT (Coding Potential Assessment Tool) is a program to discriminate coding and noncoding
sequences using logistic regression model based on 4 pure sequence linguistic features:

1. ORF (Open Reading Frame) size
2. ORF coverage
3. Fickett TESTCODE 
4. Hexamer frequency

Compared with other available tools:

1. Extremely faster. CPAT roughly processes 1000 transcripts per second.
2. No pairwise or multiple alignment is required,and thus more robust and easier to use.
3. More importantly, it performs better with improved sensitivity and specificity
